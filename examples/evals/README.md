# @minpeter/pss-example-evals

Repeatable agent evals that run against the **real** `@minpeter/pss-runtime`
agent — no separate eval universe, no mock harness. Each eval drives a live
agent thread, drains its event stream, and asserts the three questions that
matter:

- Did it call the **right tool**?
- Did it **avoid the dangerous tool**?
- Did it **say the right thing**?

## Two modes

| Mode | Command | Model | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scripted (default) | `pnpm eval` | `ai/test` scripted model | Run anywhere with no API key. Deterministic — proves the eval flow and catches wiring regressions. |
| Real | `PSS_EVAL_REAL=1 pnpm eval` | your configured model | Evaluate your actual model's behavior over time. |

The same evals run in both modes; only the `thread` factory swaps the model.

## Layout

```
evals/
  weather.eval.ts        # right tool: calls get_weather, never send_email
  safety.eval.ts         # avoid dangerous tool: refuses without sending email
  regression.eval.ts     # regression detector: a misbehaving model is caught (FAILs here)
src/
  tools.ts               # get_weather + send_email tools
  scripted-model.ts      # deterministic scripted model (ai/test)
  real-model.ts          # env-configured real model (used when PSS_EVAL_REAL=1)
  thread.ts              # per-case agent thread factory
  run.ts                 # programmatic runner
```

## Run (scripted — no key needed)

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm eval          # text summary, exits non-zero on failure
pnpm eval:json     # machine-readable JSON for CI artifacts
```

You should see a **mixed pass/fail report** — `weather` and `safety` pass, and
`regression-detect` is deliberately caught failing (the scripted model calls
`send_email` when it must not). That failure is the point: it shows a regression
is detected rather than silently shipping.

## Run against your real model

```sh
cp .env.example .env   # fill in AI_API_KEY / AI_BASE_URL / AI_MODEL
PSS_EVAL_REAL=1 pnpm eval
```

A well-behaved model refuses the unsafe request, so `regression-detect` passes
in real mode — the opposite of scripted mode. If a future model change makes it
start sending email, this eval flips to FAIL and blocks the regression.

## Writing an eval

```ts
import { defineEval, expect } from "@minpeter/pss-runtime/evals";
import { evalThread } from "../src/thread";

defineEval("weather", {
  thread: () => evalThread([ /* scripted results, ignored in real mode */ ]),
}, (it) => {
  it("calls get_weather", async (t) => {
    await t.run("서울 날씨 알려줘");

    t.calledTool("get_weather", { input: { city: "서울" } });
    t.notCalledTool("send_email");
    t.messageIncludes("서울");
    t.completed();
  });
});
```

- `thread` builds a **fresh** agent thread per case, so cases never share state.
- `t.run(input)` drives one turn; call it multiple times for a multi-turn case.
  The scope accumulates tool calls, results, and events across turns.
- Every run records agent-loop `model-usage` attempt events plus an aggregate
  `cache` object. Case and report JSON include the same cache totals.
- Assertions RECORD results (they don't throw on the first failure), so a run
  reports every failing assertion (eve-style multi-verdict). Each returns a
  handle: `.gate()` (hard fail, default) / `.soft()` (tracked) / `.atLeast(n)`
  (tracked, fatal under `--strict`).
- Tool assertions: `calledTool(name, { input, output, times })` (literal /
  RegExp / predicate matchers), `notCalledTool`, `toolOrder`, `usedNoTools`,
  `maxToolCalls`.
- Value assertions: `t.check(value, includes(...)/equals(...)/matches(schema)/similarity(...))`.

## Prompt-cache tracing

Use one case and one thread for a long-running cache workload. Exclude cold
warmup turns when gating the steady-state hit rate:

```ts
it("keeps the long-session prefix hot", async (t) => {
  for (const input of workload) {
    await t.run(input);
  }

  t.cacheHitRateAtLeast(0.8, {
    minTrackedRequests: 10,
    warmupRuns: 2,
  });
});
```

Each `run.modelUsage` entry is one successful agent-loop model attempt, while
`run.cache`, `case.cache`, and `report.cache` aggregate the provider-reported
counts. `cacheHitRate` is the sum of paired `cacheReadTokens` divided by the sum
of paired `inputTokens`; `trackedRequests` reports its sample coverage.
`cacheHitRate` remains absent when either count is unreported or tracked input
is zero, so unsupported telemetry cannot silently look like a zero-percent hit
rate. Individual aggregate token fields likewise remain absent until at least
one provider reports them. Internal automatic-compaction summary calls are not
part of a turn's event stream and are excluded.

## CLI

The runtime also ships a `pss-eval` CLI that discovers `*.eval.ts` under a
directory:

```sh
pss-eval --dir evals               # run every eval
pss-eval --dir evals weather        # filter by id substring
pss-eval --dir evals --tag safety   # filter by tag
pss-eval --dir evals --json         # machine-readable output
```

`.eval.ts` files are TypeScript, so run under a TypeScript-capable Node
(`node --experimental-strip-types`) or `tsx`.
