### Trace model-request prompt cache usage

Emit normalized, metadata-only `model-usage` events for successful agent-loop
model attempts, including provider/model/finish metadata, response latency, and
provider-reported reasoning and prompt-cache token counts. Eval runs now retain
per-attempt cache traces, preserve unreported-versus-zero counts, aggregate
cache statistics at turn, case, and report levels, and expose
`cacheHitRateAtLeast()` with warmup and sample-coverage support. Internal
automatic-compaction summary requests remain outside the public turn event
stream.

### Introduce a factory-based plugin runtime

Replace object plugins with an async factory registration kernel built around
`definePlugin`, typed `on` events, and extensible `provide` capabilities. Add
sequential async factory initialization, fail-closed hooks, subscriptions,
thread-scoped state, and index-based host diagnostics. Use `model.context` for
ephemeral model-input guards and add an atomic `model.step.before` transform
before generated messages enter history or emit mapped output events.
Dispatch the declared thread, turn, step, message, provider, compaction, and tool
lifecycle hooks at their runtime boundaries, including model-context hooks for
automatic-compaction requests. Apply typed request decisions for input
handling, transforms, compaction cancellation, tool blocking, and manual tool
recovery, and reject malformed runtime decisions with `PluginHookError`.
Plugin hook names use lowercase dotted paths, including
`provider.request.before`, `provider.response.after`,
`model.step.before`, `thread.compaction.before`, `thread.compaction.after`,
`tool.call.before`, and `turn.start.before`.

Keep thread-state shape validation inside the runtime and leave persisted
history repair to a separate version-checked recovery job with an auditable
before/after object diff.

Replace the root `Agent` constructor and `Agent.create()` surface with the async
`createAgent()` factory. `Agent` remains available as a type, while all plugin
factories finish initialization before `createAgent()` resolves.

Flatten event-backed plugin hook payloads so handlers receive their narrowed
event directly, and expose `registerTool()` as the tool capability helper.

# @minpeter/pss-runtime

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 496e522: Compress image file inputs over 1MB (default, all hosts) during attachment staging before they are written to `HostAttachmentStore`.
- d8e36b7: Collapse host types to a single `AgentHost` with `HostStore`, `HostScheduler`, and optional `HostAttachmentStore`; rename platform factories; make Cloudflare product path Agents-only; and compress image attachments to at most 1MB by default on all hosts before storage.

### Patch Changes

- 7c4bb7e: Lower the default image attachment storage budget from 1MB to 240KB so multi-image turns stay lighter while typical chat photos remain under budget.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 02c4e2a: Add durable thread event replay via `thread.events({ after, limit })`, pre-provider context budget gating for automatic compaction, and documentation for durable attachment replay behavior.

  Align public multimodal input with AI SDK 7 by removing the deprecated `UserMessageImagePart` / `{ type: "image" }` path. Use `{ type: "file", mediaType: "image" | "image/png", data }` for image inputs.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 4592e28: Add a durable `ThreadInputInbox` execution-store port with memory, file, and Cloudflare storage implementations, and wire runtime send/steer admission through durable input claim, promote, ack, release, recovery, and context-overflow compaction boundaries.
- cfb2a0f: Tighten runtime attachment ref validation, cleanup staged attachments on rejected durable inputs, and keep host-owned attachment stores authoritative for resumed work.
- d84ebb3: Add runtime-owned attachment staging, durable attachment refs, and provider-time hydration for multimodal file inputs.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 8c0f020: Add a Cloudflare Agents platform adapter that maps PSS runtime scheduling onto Agents SDK fibers, delayed schedules, and fiber recovery hooks.
- 357a6bb: Align scheduled-work semantics across platform adapters: shared work-id derivation, thread-prompt validation, and list limits now live in one platform-neutral module consumed by the memory, file, and cloudflare adapters. The in-memory scheduler now honors `runAfterMs`, dedupes runs and thread prompts like the durable adapters, and exposes `listScheduledRuns` / `listScheduledThreadPrompts` / ack APIs. A new ExecutionScheduler contract test suite runs against all three platforms.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 7346750: Add plugin-only `before-tool-call` interception so policies can request manual recovery before tool execution.

### Patch Changes

- e989f88: Add the `host` execution contract for resumable runs, durable notification
  resume, and background run capability detection. Advanced execution host, store,
  and scheduler contracts are available from `@minpeter/pss-runtime/execution`, and
  runtime-originated work can resume through `Agent.resume(runId)`.

  Background runs are now more durable: hosts can advertise background support,
  child runs are linked for cleanup/cancellation, killed sessions stop before
  cleanup waits, and stale cancelled sibling notifications are filtered without
  dropping completed work. The Cloudflare edge example shows one adapter
  implementation for Worker/Durable Object scheduling and resume.

- 5cc6285: Clean up the runtime public surface and tighten host/resume contracts.

  - Remove unused internal helpers: `runEventPlugins`, `attachRuntimeInputMeta`,
    `stripEventMeta`, and `withSteeringPlacement`. Keep the package-root
    `runPluginsForEvent` helper for compatibility with plugin test utilities.
  - Remove `AgentPlugin.events.on` (deprecated observe-only shim). Use the
    top-level `on` handler; intercept returns (`continue` / `transform` /
    `handled`) now apply to all plugins uniformly.
  - Drop `AgentSession.currentTurnId()`, `enqueueRuntimeInput()`,
    `emitObserverEvent()`, and the private `#enqueuePendingRuntimeInput()` helper;
    they were unused or test-only public-ish hooks. Observer-event behavior is now
    covered through `SessionEventDispatcher` tests.
  - Collapse `AgentLanguageModelOptions`, `AgentConstructionOptions`, and
    `AgentOptions` into a single `AgentOptions` interface.
  - Remove the empty `AgentHostCapabilities` type and replace duck-typed host
    detection with a discriminated host union (`kind: "session" | "execution" |
"durable-background"`). Session-only hosts now pass
    `host: { kind: "session", sessionStore }`.
  - `Agent.resume(runId)` no longer throws when the host cannot resume; it
    returns `null`. Add `Agent.supportsResume` to check durable-resume support
    before calling. Document that a `SessionHost` disables the in-memory
    `ExecutionHost`, so run records, tool checkpoints, and `resume()` are
    unavailable.
  - Add a `@minpeter/pss-runtime/namespace` subpath with stable namespace helpers
    (`parentSessionNamespace`, `defaultChildSessionKey`, `agentNamespace`,
    `namespacePart`, `randomAgentNamespace`) so app-owned delegation examples no
    longer copy local namespace formatting helpers.
  - Move platform adapters to domain-first public subpaths:
    `@minpeter/pss-runtime/platform/cloudflare`,
    `@minpeter/pss-runtime/platform/file`, and
    `@minpeter/pss-runtime/platform/memory`.
  - Remove the legacy `@minpeter/pss-runtime/thread-store/file` subpath; import
    `FileThreadStore` from `@minpeter/pss-runtime/platform/file`.
  - Remove Cloudflare Durable Object non-SQLite store fallbacks and legacy session
    migration; `createCloudflareDurableObjectHost` now requires `storage.sql` and
    wires SQLite event/checkpoint/session stores directly. The exported
    `InMemoryCloudflareDurableObjectStorage` remains constructible without
    arguments for test suites and supplies an in-memory SQLite-compatible backing
    store by default.
  - Remove no-op internal plumbing: the always-true observer-event filter in the
    agent loop and the unused `BufferedAgentRun.close()` reason parameter.

- 4a2ab2b: Expose a Cloudflare notification idempotency helper so Durable Object alarm handlers can recover product-level source keys from runtime-scoped scheduled prompts.
- d1c015c: Add Cloudflare notification dispatch helpers and context-aware alarm draining for multi-user Durable Object runtimes.
- 74dc8de: Fix Cloudflare notification dispatch dedupe scope, active notification observer
  events, and stale or budgeted alarm retry handling.
- 320c01c: Add a Node platform adapter with file-backed thread and execution hosts, including resumable run storage, notification inbox persistence, checkpoints, events, and local scheduled-work files. Also move Cloudflare internals under `src/platform/cloudflare` and publish platform adapters under `@minpeter/pss-runtime/platform/*`.
- 617b9f9: Refresh dependencies across the v0.1 workspace, including AI SDK 7 latest.
- b03d3ac: Normalize AI SDK fallback tool-call ids such as `delegate_to_researcher_0` to
  stable `call_*` ids so tool results, tool execution checkpoints, and session
  mapping stay consistent across model snapshots.
- 836a1c4: Rework `./evals` into an eve-parity, record-based evaluation engine.

  Evals drive a real `Agent` thread and drain its event stream — no separate eval
  universe, no new runtime dependency. The assertion model now records results
  rather than throwing on the first failure, so a single run reports every failing
  assertion (eve-style multi-verdict).

  New assertion surface on the per-case scope `t`:

  - run-level: `calledTool(name, { input, output, times })`,
    `notCalledTool`, `toolOrder`, `usedNoTools`, `maxToolCalls`,
    `messageIncludes`, `completed`, `didNotFail`, `noFailedActions`, `event`,
    `outputEquals`, `outputMatches`
  - value assertions via `t.check(value, builder)` with `includes`, `equals`,
    `matches` (Standard Schema / Zod), `similarity` (Levenshtein)
  - severity on every assertion: `.gate()` (hard, default), `.soft()`,
    `.atLeast(threshold)` (tracked, fatal only under `--strict`)

  Tool matchers accept literal (partial-deep), RegExp, or predicate. The runner
  computes a gate-based verdict, tracks soft misses ("scored"), and the `pss-eval`
  CLI gains `--strict` (soft-threshold misses also fail).

  LLM judge (`t.judge.autoevals.closedQA / factuality / summarizes`): the only
  model-backed assertions, soft by default, graded via a resolved judge model
  (`judge: { model }` per-eval or per-call `{ model }`), never the agent under
  test. Judge assertions are declared synchronously during the test and resolved
  by the runner after the test function runs, so `.atLeast`/`.gate` chain without
  `await`. Calling `t.judge.*` with no judge model records a failed gate.

  This is a breaking change to the eval authoring API: cases now receive a
  recording scope (`t`) instead of `{ run }` + a throw-based `expect`. Multi-turn
  cases accumulate state across `t.run()` calls.

- 1f3a46c: Remove the public runtime LLM function adapter surface. Agent model execution now accepts AI SDK LanguageModel objects directly, and runtime tests use AI SDK MockLanguageModelV4 fixtures.
- 41736e7: Add opt-in automatic Thread compaction for long-running agents.

  - Add `AgentOptions.autoCompaction` with validated `minMessages` and
    `retainMessages` thresholds.
  - Persist compaction summaries as `pss_thread_compaction` rows while keeping the
    full durable Thread log intact.
  - Schedule compaction after successful user-input turns without blocking turn
    completion.

- b21c318: Split durable/background host capabilities into smaller execution subpath contracts and publish a Cloudflare Durable Object adapter from `@minpeter/pss-runtime/platform/cloudflare`.
- fedd6be: Add `inspectNodeFileThread` and `nodeFileThreadStorageFile` to the Node platform
  adapter for runtime-owned local thread storage inspection.
- b03d3ac: Implement constructor-level `plugins: [...]` event observers and input intercept
  middleware.
- 0ffe9e7: Add plugin-first session persistence, memory, and event-first runtime control.

  - Keep `run.events()` as the app-owned runtime control loop for synchronized rendering, tracing, and continuation policy.
  - Add constructor-level `plugins: [...]` support with a single `on(context)` handler per plugin.
  - `on` is observe-only for most events. Three input event types (`user-text`, `user-message`, `runtime-input`) support intercept returns: `{ action: "continue" }`, `{ action: "transform", event }`, or `{ action: "handled" }`.
  - Plugins run in registration order; transforms chain so each plugin sees the previous plugin's event.
  - Route plugin logic on `event.meta?.source` (`send`, `steer`, `notify`, `delegate`). Meta is stripped before session history persistence and model mapping, so it never reaches the LLM prompt.
  - Use `host: { kind: "session", sessionStore }` for session-only persistence, `run.events()` plus `session.steer()` for app control, or constructor `plugins: [...]` for reusable middleware.

- 515b089: Fix the runtime README to document the exported `thread-store/file` subpath without referencing the removed `session-store/file` path.
- c8bf377: Support scheduled work payload LIKE deletes in the local Durable Object SQL test adapter.
- a5418f0: Support secondary-index scheduled work deletes in the local Durable Object SQL test adapter.
- ae58a13: Store Cloudflare Durable Object notification records in SQLite rows with legacy KV read-through, and make runtime checkpoint ids include run, version, and phase metadata.
- f3c4461: Harden Cloudflare Durable Object storage for production agent threads.

  - Make `RunStore.create()` insert-only and return typed duplicate results so
    notification idempotency races do not overwrite canonical runs.
  - Stop retrying scheduled non-notification runs forever when the runtime cannot
    resume them.
  - Store lower-level resume checkpoints as bounded thread references instead of
    full history snapshots.
  - Normalize scheduled work rows with `thread_key` and `run_id` indexes for
    exact cleanup.
  - Add append-delta writes and chunked oversized thread-message payloads for the
    SQLite thread store.

- d1e0186: Add a local Cloudflare Durable Object storage stress harness, including an opt-in 200MB-scale extreme profile, and expose host-level payload budget configuration.
- ae8de0e: Replace the async Agent factory with direct construction and keep delegation
  app-owned through ordinary tools, sessions, and host-owned background runs.
  Runtime-owned subagent APIs and built-in delegation tools are not shipped; see
  the sync and background example packages for blocking and background
  delegation patterns.
- 641ccbf: Rename execution, Cloudflare scheduling, and notification APIs from
  `sessionKey`/`resumeSession`/scheduled session prompts to
  `threadKey`/`resumeThread`/scheduled thread prompts. Thread keys are now the
  public app-facing address for linear conversation history, while existing
  storage-session internals remain opaque behind the runtime host boundary.
- 8c3e696: Replace legacy session/run public aliases with Thread, Turn, and Checkpoint runtime naming.
- 307f8fd: Unify user-originated thread events as `user-input` and simplify public thread
  input to plain text, text arrays, or content-part arrays. Object-shaped
  `user-text` and `user-message` inputs are no longer part of the public
  `send()`/`steer()` surface; notification/resume internals still persist a typed
  `user-input` payload.

  Add noncanonical `thread.overlay(input)` for next-turn runtime context.
  Overlays accept the same input shapes as `send()`, are chainable, and enter the
  next turn as `runtime-input` before the user message rather than as another
  human `user-input` event. Overlay context is visible to the current model turn
  but is excluded from stored thread history and automatic compaction summaries.

  Add notification resume overlays so durable notification turns can inject fresh
  per-run context without baking that context into the canonical thread log.

- 0a1f556: Add `DurableObjectSqliteEventStore` and `DurableObjectSqliteCheckpointStore`,
  the append-only SQLite stores used by the Cloudflare Durable Object host.

  Like `DurableObjectSqliteSessionStore`, they persist one small SQLite row per
  event / per checkpoint instead of re-writing a whole per-run list into a single
  `storage.put` value on every append. A run with many large tool-result events or
  full-history checkpoints can no longer cross the Durable Object ~2MB per-value
  limit (`SQLITE_TOOBIG`) by accumulation — the failure that surfaced as
  `Error: string or blob too big: SQLITE_TOOBIG` on the `afterTool` checkpoint
  write after tools such as `web_search`.

  `createCloudflareDurableObjectHost` now requires SQLite-backed Durable Object
  storage (`storage.sql`) and wires these SQLite stores directly. Event cursors
  (1-based skip offsets), checkpoint `stale-version` optimistic checks, and
  `latest()` semantics are preserved. Both stores are re-exported from
  `@minpeter/pss-runtime/platform/cloudflare`.

- b687931: Add `DurableObjectSqliteSessionStore`, an append-only session store for
  SQLite-backed Durable Objects, and make the Cloudflare Durable Object host use it
  by default. It persists conversation history as one small SQLite row per message
  (delta-append on commit, reconstruct on load) instead of re-serializing the
  entire snapshot into a single `storage.put` value every turn, so long sessions no
  longer cross the Durable Object ~2MB per-value limit (`SQLITE_TOOBIG`).
  Rollbacks soft-delete trailing rows and optimistic version/conflict semantics are
  preserved.

  `createCloudflareDurableObjectHost` now requires SQLite-backed Durable Object
  storage (`storage.sql`). Callers can still pass `sessionStore` when they need to
  provide a custom session store.

- Sync dependency updates from main into the v0.1 prerelease line.
- 1dd09de: Replace the public `agent.session(key)` entrypoint with `agent.thread(key)`.
  Threads are the app-facing conversation unit; runtime session state remains an
  internal storage concern behind the thread handle. `agent.thread({ key, scope })`
  now provides an optional scoped address for multi-user integrations while
  preserving opaque session storage under the host boundary.

  Rename execution, Cloudflare scheduling, and notification APIs from
  `sessionKey`/`resumeSession`/scheduled session prompts to
  `threadKey`/`resumeThread`/scheduled thread prompts so edge apps can model
  linear conversation history without leaking storage-session terminology.

- a58c756: Rename Cloudflare SQLite thread history tables from `pss_session_*` to `pss_thread_*` with legacy row migration, and store run records in SQLite rows instead of Durable Object KV values.
- 11dd14d: Expose per-run eval traces in case reports so multi-turn evals can inspect each input, event stream, tool call, and visible output.

## 0.1.0-next.24

### Minor Changes

- 7346750: Add plugin-only `before-tool-call` interception so policies can request manual recovery before tool execution.

### Patch Changes

- 617b9f9: Refresh dependencies across the v0.1 workspace, including AI SDK 7 latest.
- 11dd14d: Expose per-run eval traces in case reports so multi-turn evals can inspect each input, event stream, tool call, and visible output.

## 0.1.0-next.23

### Patch Changes

- 836a1c4: Rework `./evals` into an eve-parity, record-based evaluation engine.

  Evals drive a real `Agent` thread and drain its event stream — no separate eval
  universe, no new runtime dependency. The assertion model now records results
  rather than throwing on the first failure, so a single run reports every failing
  assertion (eve-style multi-verdict).

  New assertion surface on the per-case scope `t`:

  - run-level: `calledTool(name, { input, output, times })`,
    `notCalledTool`, `toolOrder`, `usedNoTools`, `maxToolCalls`,
    `messageIncludes`, `completed`, `didNotFail`, `noFailedActions`, `event`,
    `outputEquals`, `outputMatches`
  - value assertions via `t.check(value, builder)` with `includes`, `equals`,
    `matches` (Standard Schema / Zod), `similarity` (Levenshtein)
  - severity on every assertion: `.gate()` (hard, default), `.soft()`,
    `.atLeast(threshold)` (tracked, fatal only under `--strict`)

  This is a breaking change to the eval authoring API: cases now receive a

  cases accumulate state across `t.run()` calls.

- fedd6be: Add `inspectNodeFileThread` and `nodeFileThreadStorageFile` to the Node platform
  adapter for runtime-owned local thread storage inspection.

## 0.1.0-next.22

### Patch Changes

- Rename visible assistant response events from `assistant-text` to `assistant-output`.
  The new name better matches the thread model where user messages are inputs and
  assistant messages are model outputs appended back into the thread.

## 0.1.0-next.21

### Patch Changes

- Unify user-originated thread events as `user-input` and simplify public thread
  input to plain text, text arrays, or content-part arrays. Object-shaped
  `user-text` and `user-message` inputs are no longer part of the public
  `send()`/`steer()` surface; notification/resume internals still persist a typed
  `user-input` payload.

  Add noncanonical `thread.overlay(input)` for next-turn runtime context.
  Overlays accept the same input shapes as `send()`, are chainable, and enter the
  next turn as `runtime-input` before the user message rather than as another
  human `user-input` event. Overlay context is visible to the current model turn
  but is excluded from stored thread history and automatic compaction summaries.

  Add notification resume overlays so durable notification turns can inject fresh
  per-run context without baking that context into the canonical thread log.

## 0.1.0-next.20

### Patch Changes

- 41736e7: Add opt-in automatic Thread compaction for long-running agents.

  - Add `AgentOptions.autoCompaction` with validated `minMessages` and
    `retainMessages` thresholds.
  - Persist compaction summaries as `pss_thread_compaction` rows while keeping the
    full durable Thread log intact.
  - Schedule compaction after successful user-input turns without blocking turn
    completion.

## 0.1.0-next.19

### Patch Changes

- 515b089: Fix the runtime README to document the exported `thread-store/file` subpath without referencing the removed `session-store/file` path.

## 0.1.0-next.18

### Patch Changes

- 320c01c: Add a Node platform adapter with file-backed thread and execution hosts, including resumable run storage, notification inbox persistence, checkpoints, events, and local scheduled-work files. Also move Cloudflare internals under `src/platform/cloudflare` while keeping the public Cloudflare subpath stable.
- 8c3e696: Replace legacy session/run public aliases with Thread, Turn, and Checkpoint runtime naming.

## 0.1.0-next.17

### Patch Changes

- c8bf377: Support scheduled work payload LIKE deletes in the local Durable Object SQL test adapter.

## 0.1.0-next.16

### Patch Changes

- a5418f0: Support secondary-index scheduled work deletes in the local Durable Object SQL test adapter.

## 0.1.0-next.15

### Patch Changes

- d1e0186: Add a local Cloudflare Durable Object storage stress harness, including an opt-in 200MB-scale extreme profile, and expose host-level payload budget configuration.

## 0.1.0-next.14

### Patch Changes

- f3c4461: Harden Cloudflare Durable Object storage for production agent threads.

  - Make `RunStore.create()` insert-only and return typed duplicate results so
    notification idempotency races do not overwrite canonical runs.
  - Stop retrying scheduled non-notification runs forever when the runtime cannot
    resume them.
  - Store lower-level resume checkpoints as bounded thread references instead of
    full history snapshots.
  - Normalize scheduled work rows with `thread_key` and `run_id` indexes for
    exact cleanup.
  - Add append-delta writes and chunked oversized thread-message payloads for the
    SQLite thread store.

## 0.1.0-next.13

### Patch Changes

- ae58a13: Store Cloudflare Durable Object notification records in SQLite rows with legacy KV read-through, and make runtime checkpoint ids include run, version, and phase metadata.

## 0.1.0-next.12

### Patch Changes

- a58c756: Rename Cloudflare SQLite thread history tables from `pss_session_*` to `pss_thread_*` with legacy row migration, and store run records in SQLite rows instead of Durable Object KV values.

## 0.1.0-next.11

### Patch Changes

- Harden Cloudflare Durable Object storage for long-running agent threads and
  rename the runtime domain from sessions to threads. Runtime storage now rejects
  oversized single-row payloads before Durable Object writes, stores tool
  checkpoints as bounded thread references instead of full history snapshots, and
  uses a SQLite row queue for scheduled Cloudflare work.

  The public app-facing API now uses `agent.thread(...)`, `ThreadInput`, and
  ThreadStore names. Deprecated Session aliases remain as explicit compatibility
  adapters, while the coding-agent local thread store imports have moved to the
  new thread-store subpaths.

## 0.1.0-next.10

### Patch Changes

- 641ccbf: Rename execution, Cloudflare scheduling, and notification APIs from
  `sessionKey`/`resumeSession`/scheduled session prompts to
  `threadKey`/`resumeThread`/scheduled thread prompts. Thread keys are now the
  public app-facing address for linear conversation history, while existing
  storage-session internals remain opaque behind the runtime host boundary.

## 0.1.0-next.9

### Patch Changes

- 4a2ab2b: Expose a Cloudflare notification idempotency helper so Durable Object alarm handlers can recover product-level source keys from runtime-scoped scheduled prompts.
- 1dd09de: Replace the public `agent.session(key)` entrypoint with `agent.thread(key)`.
  Threads are the app-facing conversation unit; runtime session state remains an
  internal storage concern behind the thread handle. `agent.thread({ key, scope })`
  now provides an optional scoped address for multi-user integrations while
  preserving opaque session storage under the host boundary.

## 0.1.0-next.8

### Patch Changes

- 5cc6285: Clean up the runtime public surface and tighten host/resume contracts.

  - Remove unused internal helpers: `runEventPlugins`, `attachRuntimeInputMeta`,
    `stripEventMeta`, and `withSteeringPlacement`. Keep the package-root
    `runPluginsForEvent` helper for compatibility with plugin test utilities.
  - Remove `AgentPlugin.events.on` (deprecated observe-only shim). Use the
    top-level `on` handler; intercept returns (`continue` / `transform` /
    `handled`) now apply to all plugins uniformly.
  - Drop `AgentSession.currentTurnId()`, `enqueueRuntimeInput()`,
    `emitObserverEvent()`, and the private `#enqueuePendingRuntimeInput()` helper;
    they were unused or test-only public-ish hooks. Observer-event behavior is now
    covered through `SessionEventDispatcher` tests.
  - Collapse `AgentLanguageModelOptions`, `AgentConstructionOptions`, and
    `AgentOptions` into a single `AgentOptions` interface.
  - Remove the empty `AgentHostCapabilities` type and replace duck-typed host
    detection with a discriminated host union (`kind: "session" | "execution" |
"durable-background"`). Session-only hosts now pass
    `host: { kind: "session", sessionStore }`.
  - `Agent.resume(runId)` no longer throws when the host cannot resume; it
    returns `null`. Add `Agent.supportsResume` to check durable-resume support
    before calling. Document that a `SessionHost` disables the in-memory
    `ExecutionHost`, so run records, tool checkpoints, and `resume()` are
    unavailable.
  - Add a `@minpeter/pss-runtime/namespace` subpath with stable namespace helpers
    (`parentSessionNamespace`, `defaultChildSessionKey`, `agentNamespace`,
    `namespacePart`, `randomAgentNamespace`) so app-owned delegation examples no
    longer copy local namespace formatting helpers.
  - Remove Cloudflare Durable Object non-SQLite store fallbacks and legacy session
    migration; `createCloudflareDurableObjectHost` now requires `storage.sql` and
    wires SQLite event/checkpoint/session stores directly. The exported
    `InMemoryCloudflareDurableObjectStorage` remains constructible without
    arguments for test suites and supplies an in-memory SQLite-compatible backing
    store by default.
  - Remove no-op internal plumbing: the always-true observer-event filter in the
    agent loop and the unused `BufferedAgentRun.close()` reason parameter.

- d1c015c: Add Cloudflare notification dispatch helpers and context-aware alarm draining for multi-user Durable Object runtimes.
- 74dc8de: Fix Cloudflare notification dispatch dedupe scope, active notification observer
  events, and stale or budgeted alarm retry handling.

## 0.1.0-next.7

### Patch Changes

- 0a1f556: Add `DurableObjectSqliteEventStore` and `DurableObjectSqliteCheckpointStore`,
  the append-only SQLite counterparts to the legacy KV event/checkpoint stores.

  Like `DurableObjectSqliteSessionStore`, they persist one small SQLite row per
  event / per checkpoint instead of re-writing the whole per-run list into a
  single `storage.put` value on every append. A run with many large tool-result
  events or full-history checkpoints can no longer cross the Durable Object ~2MB
  per-value limit (`SQLITE_TOOBIG`) by accumulation — the failure that surfaced as
  `Error: string or blob too big: SQLITE_TOOBIG` on the `afterTool` checkpoint
  write after tools such as `web_search`.

  `createCloudflareDurableObjectHost` now selects these SQLite stores
  automatically when `storage.sql` is available (ChatRoom-style SQLite-backed
  Durable Objects), and keeps the legacy KV stores on non-SQLite storage, so no
  caller change is required. Event cursors (1-based skip offsets), checkpoint
  `stale-version` optimistic checks, and `latest()` semantics are preserved
  byte-for-byte. Both new stores are re-exported from
  `@minpeter/pss-runtime/cloudflare`.

## 0.1.0-next.6

### Patch Changes

- Sync dependency updates from main into the v0.1 prerelease line.

## 0.1.0-next.5

### Patch Changes

- b687931: Add `DurableObjectSqliteSessionStore`, an append-only session store for
  SQLite-backed Durable Objects. It persists conversation history as one small
  SQLite row per message (delta-append on commit, reconstruct on load) instead of
  re-serializing the entire snapshot into a single `storage.put` value every turn,
  so long sessions no longer cross the Durable Object ~2MB per-value limit
  (`SQLITE_TOOBIG`). Rollbacks soft-delete the trailing rows, the optimistic
  version/conflict semantics are preserved byte-for-byte, and any pre-existing
  `storage.put` snapshot is lazily migrated into rows on first access. Opt in via
  the existing `sessionStore` option of `createCloudflareDurableObjectHost`; the
  default store is unchanged.

## 0.1.0-next.4

### Patch Changes

- 1f3a46c: Remove the public runtime LLM function adapter surface. Agent model execution now accepts AI SDK LanguageModel objects directly, and runtime tests use AI SDK MockLanguageModelV4 fixtures.

## 0.1.0-next.3

### Patch Changes

- fc024ec: Remove the unreleased runtime-owned subagent API and implementation. Delegation now stays app-owned through ordinary tools, sessions, and host-owned background runs; see the sync and background examples for those patterns.
- b21c318: Split durable/background host capabilities into smaller execution subpath contracts and publish a Cloudflare Durable Object adapter from `@minpeter/pss-runtime/cloudflare`.

## 0.1.0-next.2

### Patch Changes

- e989f88: Add the `host` execution contract for resumable runs and durable
  notification resume. Advanced execution host, store, and scheduler contracts
  are available from `@minpeter/pss-runtime/execution`, and runtime-originated
  work can resume through `Agent.resume(runId)`.

  Durable background scheduling is host-owned: apps can persist their own run
  records and completion notifications while the runtime keeps the generic
  execution store, scheduler, and notification resume primitives.

- b03d3ac: Normalize AI SDK fallback tool-call ids such as `lookup_0` to
  `call_*` so app-owned tools can correlate model tool calls with their own
  durable work records.
- b03d3ac: Implement constructor-level `plugins: [...]` event observers and lifecycle middleware.

## 0.1.0-next.1

### Patch Changes

- ae8de0e: Replace the async Agent factory with direct construction and keep
  delegation as app-owned tool composition.

## 0.1.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- 0ffe9e7: Add plugin-first session persistence, memory, and compaction APIs, plus event-first runtime control.

  - Keep `run.events()` as the app-owned runtime control loop for synchronized rendering, tracing, and continuation policy.
  - Expand plugin lifecycle middleware with `turn.before`, `step.before`, `step.after`, and `turn.after` handlers that can call scoped `steer(...)`.
  - Route plugin lifecycle handler failures through the returned run so callers own observability.
  - Add runtime-owned tool policy middleware with `tool.call` and `tool.result` for allow, modify, reject-and-continue, synthesize, error, and result replacement flows.
  - Use `host: { sessionStore }` for persistence, `run.events()` plus `session.steer()` for app control, or plugin lifecycle handlers for reusable middleware.

### Patch Changes

- 3761c93: Add turn-scoped session overlays with non-persistent `session.overlay(input)` runtime context, overlay lifecycle events, and plugin lifecycle overlay helpers.

## 0.0.10

### Patch Changes

- 5fc427d: Hide the internal agent loop runner from the root runtime export and clarify the session store version contract so stores own loaded-session versions while commit payloads carry state only.

  Rename the synchronized run event iterator from `run.stream()` to `run.events()` across the runtime API and examples. This intentionally removes `run.stream()`; replace calls with `run.events()`.

## 0.0.9

### Patch Changes

- 20103d2: Make the coding-agent TUI subpath import-safe, correct multimodal docs, and trim redundant runtime type exports.

## 0.0.8

### Patch Changes

- c991a6a: Replace the public current-turn input API with `session.steer(input)` and keep
  `session.send(input)` as the new-turn queue. Active TUI submissions now steer the
  current run through the session API.

## 0.0.7

### Patch Changes

- c71ea7d: Add runtime `toolChoice` configuration and lifecycle events for turns and steps.

## 0.0.6

### Patch Changes

- 37a14b9: Add serializable image/file content parts to `agent.send` and session sends, preserving them through runtime-owned session snapshots.
- 37a14b9: Document first-pass image input support in the runtime session/send API.
- 1b43c77: Keep runtime transcripts event-only while storing session continuation state as an internal versioned snapshot.

## 0.0.5

### Patch Changes

- fbe0448: Make agent sessions runtime-owned and durable through an opaque session store boundary, including memory/file stores and coding-agent TUI file-backed sessions.

## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 23cce55: Accept AI SDK ToolSet directly for runtime Agent tools.

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- c5b7c8b: Allow `AgentSession.submit()` user text to be passed as an array of strings for host-rendered per-turn context.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- f503ccd: Enhance `AgentSession` with state hydration, mutation tracking, and broader TypeScript type exports:

  - Add `history` hydration through `AgentSession` constructor options.
  - Introduce `getHistory()` to retrieve the current snapshot of the agent's message history.
  - Add lifecycle callbacks to `AgentSession` and model history for serialized mutation-time history snapshots.
  - Keep `kill()` from hanging active turns that are waiting on stalled history persistence.
  - Export `AgentMessage` globally from `@minpeter/pss-runtime` for clean external representation of internal AI SDK message structures.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 8f03383: Publish the initial pss-next runtime and coding-agent packages from the new Turborepo workspace.
