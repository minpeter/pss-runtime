### Publish built-in extensions to the latest dist-tag

The extension manager resolves tagless installs through `latest`, so the built-in extensions now publish there instead of `next`; this release also moves `latest` off the stale pre-#335 builds.

## @minpeter/pss-extension-web@0.0.1-next.3 (next)

### Publish built-in extensions as installable packages

## @minpeter/pss-extension-web@0.0.1-next.2 (next)

### Declare the coding agent dependency in extensions

Add @minpeter/pss-coding-agent as a dev dependency of the LaTeX, Mermaid, and web extensions so Turborepo 2.10.8 boundaries accepts the /extension imports.

## @minpeter/pss-extension-web@0.0.1-next.1 (next)

### Update the AI SDK

## @minpeter/pss-extension-web@0.0.1-next.0 (next)

### Update the AI SDK

Update the runtime, coding agent, and web extension to AI SDK 7.0.45.
