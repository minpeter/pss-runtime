# Robust compaction-score results

Date: 2026-07-24

## Protocol

- Three deterministic calls per trial: one summary, one batched full-context
  evaluation, one batched compacted-context evaluation.
- Three independent fixture seeds by two repetitions: six valid trials.
- 24 hidden questions per trial, 144 paired observations total.
- Full-context control must be perfect.
- Exact-match scoring with trim/case/whitespace/trailing-period normalization.
- Summary quality and compression are reported separately.

The local coding-agent provider could not execute the matrix because it
returned `User banned`. The runner correctly recorded this as
`summary-provider-failure` and excluded it from quality statistics. To complete
the prompt-quality experiment, the same exported fixtures, production summary
contract, compaction wrapper, shared tail, and batched questions were evaluated
by independent deep-worker model calls.

## First structured-contract run

| Metric | Result |
|---|---:|
| Valid trials | 6/6 |
| Full-context control | 144/144 |
| Compacted retention | 138/144 (95.83%) |
| Wilson 95% CI | 91.21%-98.08% |
| Trial mean / population SD | 95.83% / 3.40% |
| Trial range | 91.67%-100% |
| Mean summary/input ratio | 38.10% |
| Summary-ratio SD | 1.38% |

All six misses were paraphrases of the task blocker or next action. Project
facts, exact identifiers, corrections, tool evidence, and task status were
preserved.

## Verbatim labeled-state iteration

The contract was changed to copy source values labeled `Next action`,
`Blocker`, `in-progress`, `blocked`, or `queued` verbatim and to emit no
preamble.

| Metric | Result |
|---|---:|
| Valid trials | 6/6 |
| Full-context control | 144/144 |
| Compacted retention | 144/144 (100%) |
| Wilson 95% CI | 97.40%-100% |
| Trial mean / population SD | 100% / 0% |
| Trial range | 100%-100% |
| Mean summary/input ratio | 34.09% |
| Summary-ratio SD | 3.33% |
| Summary-ratio range | 28.97%-38.39% |

The targeted change removed all task-continuation misses while reducing the
average summary ratio by four percentage points.

## Threats to validity

- Six trials establish a useful regression baseline, not universal model
  superiority.
- The final matrix used the independent worker model path because the
  configured coding-agent provider was banned.
- Exact synthetic facts cover continuity failure modes but do not replace
  long-running production telemetry.
- Provider/model changes require rerunning the matrix; scores are not portable
  across models.

## Expanded corner-case matrix

The registry was expanded with one baseline, one two-hop lifecycle, and one
boundary-noise fixture, each repeated twice. Summary generation and evaluation
used different worker model roles to reduce producer/evaluator leakage.

| Scenario | Result |
|---|---:|
| Baseline | 48/48 |
| Lifecycle, two hops | 34/34 |
| Boundary noise | 22/22 |
| Aggregate | 104/104 |

The expanded questions found no additional recall miss, but they exposed a
compression failure that recall-only scoring had hidden:

- lifecycle hop 1 summary/input ratio: `1.048-1.215`
- lifecycle final hop ratio: `0.732-0.810`

The first summary could therefore be larger than the source context. Production
compaction now caps output adaptively to half the estimated summary input and
rejects any result that is not smaller than its source. The benchmark records
that rejection as `non-compressing-summary`, separate from provider failures.

Two repeated lifecycle trials after the fix retained `17/17` each while reducing
hop ratios to:

- hop 1: `0.551-0.566`
- hop 2: `0.490-0.540`
