# pss-next

Small agent runtime workspace.

- `@minpeter/pss-runtime`: runtime, threads, model loop, and plugin kernel.
- `@minpeter/pss-coding-agent`: model wiring and the `pss` TUI, with
  OpenSearch-backed `web_search` and `web_fetch` tools enabled by default.

## Use

```ts
import { createOpenAICompatible } from "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible";
import { createAgent } from "@minpeter/pss-runtime";
import { createEnv } from "@t3-oss/env-core";
import { config as loadEnv } from "dotenv";
import { z } from "zod";

loadEnv({ path: ".env", quiet: true, override: true });
const env = createEnv({
  runtimeEnv: process.env,
  server: {
    AI_API_KEY: z.string().trim().min(1),
    AI_BASE_URL: z.url().trim().default("https://apis.opengateway.ai/v1"),
    AI_MODEL: z.string().trim().min(1).default("minimax/MiniMax-M2.7"),
  },
});

const provider = createOpenAICompatible({
  name: "custom",
  apiKey: env.AI_API_KEY,
  baseURL: env.AI_BASE_URL,
});

const agent = await createAgent({
  instructions: "Keep every answer under 3 lines.",
  model: provider(env.AI_MODEL),
});
const turn = await agent.send("Hello");
for await (const event of turn.events()) {
  console.dir(event, { depth: null });
}
```

`turn.events()` is synchronized and drives the turn. Consume it to let the
runtime cross lifecycle boundaries such as `turn-start`, `step-start`, and
`step-end`.
Use `thread.send(input)` for a new user turn. If a turn is already active, the
new turn is queued until the active turn finishes. Use `thread.steer(input)` when
the input should steer the active turn; if no turn is active, it starts a normal
turn.

```ts
const thread = agent.thread("default");
const turn = await thread.send("Write a two sentence summary.");
let addedConstraint = false;

for await (const event of turn.events()) {
  if (event.type === "step-end" && !addedConstraint) {
    addedConstraint = true;
    await thread.steer("Keep the second sentence under 10 words.");
  }
}
```

The guard matters. `step-end` runtime input asks the runtime to continue the
current turn before the next model snapshot, even after final-looking assistant
text. Adding input on every `step-end` can keep a turn running indefinitely.

Steering additions appear as `runtime-input` events: runtime/API-originated input
mapped internally to the model's user role, separate from human `user-input`
events.

## Plugins

Plugins are async factories. Register typed lifecycle handlers with `on()` and
capabilities such as tools with `provide()`:

```ts
import {
  createAgent,
  definePlugin,
  registerTool,
} from "@minpeter/pss-runtime";

const appPlugin = definePlugin((pss) => {
  pss.on("turn.end", (event) => {
    console.log(event.type);
  });
  pss.provide(registerTool({ name: "weather", tool: weatherTool }));
});

const agent = await createAgent({ model, plugins: [appPlugin] });
```

Plugin factories initialize sequentially before `createAgent()` resolves.
`Agent` remains available as a type, but agent creation must go through the async
factory. Factory and hook failures fail closed. See
[`packages/runtime/README.md`](packages/runtime/README.md#plugins) for lifecycle
hooks, request decisions, thread-scoped state, and host integrations.

The runtime `send` API also accepts JSON-serializable multimodal content parts
for model providers that support them:

```ts
await agent.send([
  { type: "text", text: "What changed in this screenshot?" },
  { type: "file", data: "data:image/png;base64,...", mediaType: "image/png" },
]);
```

Inline image/file bytes and base64 data URLs are staged into the runtime's
`attachmentStore` before thread state is committed. Durable events and snapshots
store only internal `pss-attachment:` refs, and the runtime hydrates those refs
back into bytes immediately before calling the model. Custom hosts that accept
byte inputs must provide an `attachmentStore` with `put`, `get`, and `delete`;
remote `http(s)` media stays as a provider URL/reference and is not fetched by
the runtime.

Run the TUI:

```sh
pnpm dlx @minpeter/pss-coding-agent
```

or install it:

```sh
pnpm add -g @minpeter/pss-coding-agent
pss
```

In the `pss` TUI, submitting while a run is active steers the current run.
Submitting while idle starts a normal new turn.

## Develop

Use Node.js 24 or later. The repository's supported development version is
recorded in `.node-version`.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
pnpm dev:tui
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm build
```

## Env

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.

```env
AI_API_KEY=...
AI_BASE_URL=...
AI_MODEL=...
```

The `pss` TUI enables OpenSearch-backed `web_search` and `web_fetch` tools by
default. Applications can still provide their own tools explicitly to the runtime
or TUI entrypoint.

The `pss` TUI stores threads in `~/.pss/threads` by default. Override with
`PSS_THREAD_DIR` and `PSS_THREAD_KEY` when you want repo-local storage or a
shared conversation key.

## Release

```sh
pnpm tegami
```

Commit the generated `.tegami/*.md` changelog with the feature or fix. On
`main`, `pnpm tegami ci` opens or updates the Version Packages pull request.
After that PR merges, the next release run publishes from the committed Tegami
publish lock using npm Trusted Publishing.
